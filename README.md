# web-appbuilder-typescript-examples
Featuring examples of using TypeScript with Web AppBuilder

## Examples

1. `developer` - if you're not using the builder interface, this version extracts Web AppBuilder, copies the config files for your app, builds your widgets, and hosts the files.
1. `builder` - example using TypeScript and Grunt to copy files to your local Web AppBuilder Developer Edition so you can use your custom widgets in the builder interface. (COMING SOON)
